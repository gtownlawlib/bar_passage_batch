# Bar Passage Batch Uploader
Custom Drupal 7 module using Batch API to import names from an uploaded CSV into nodes

This module is written for a site that tracks names of people who pass bar exams in various jurisdictions.

Batch import form asks for exam jurisdiction, exam date (month & year), and the source of the data being imported (e.g., New York Law Journal). The final field is a file upload for a CSV file. The CSV should be four columns: first name, middle name (optional), last name, and suffix (optional) in that orderâ€”with no header row.

The batch import is coded to populate a node type named 'person' that contains the following fields:
1. First Name (field_first_name) (text) (REQUIRED)
2. Middle Name/Initial (field_middle_name) (text) (OPTIONAL)
3. Last Name (field_last_name) (text) (REQUIRED)
4. Suffix (field_suffix) (text) (OPTIONAL)
5. State/Jurisdiction (field_state) (list_text) (REQUIRED)
6. Exam Date (field_exam_date) (datetime) (REQUIRED)
7. Source (field_source) (text) (REQUIRED)

Fields 1-4 are mapped from the CSV columns. Fields 4-6 are mapped from form data and will be the same for all created nodes in each batch import.
